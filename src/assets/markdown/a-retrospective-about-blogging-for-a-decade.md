# A retrospective about blogging for a decade

Time to celebrate? I don't know. [Time has changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItJwb7wUFFI), my blog has changed and (for sure) I have changed as well. Nevertheless, let's gather some info about this website and it's evolvement over the past ten years.

## In the beginning there was an empty file

In 2015 I had some free time. Already experimenting with the Linux Desktop for a while, I had the opportunity to save this domain via a very good friend. Yes, I did not even had a credit card at that time. [Taler](https://www.taler.net/) was not arround yet and I don't trust payment systems owned by large companies (making money out of thin air).

It all started with a *friend-hosted* [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/). First posts consisted of music reviews, with inspiration taken from [De:Bug](http://de-bug.de/), which is apparently down at this time of writing. I developed the "Joy of Writing" while filling my own website. Everything starts with an (almost) empty page. **You** decide what to insert, just do the first step and don't overthink. Follow your heart.

## Develop yourself and your site

Approximately two years afterwards, I reworked the whole page via "brand new" Angular 2 framework. There was no real need for it technically, but I digged deeper in web development meanwhile and customization of a Wiki is kinda limited, especially due my lack of PHP skills.

TypeScript made me struggle very often in those days. Somehow I managed to get rid of functionality and CSS (for mobile!) bugs. Especially the music player took me like years to get working properly.

Looking back, probably I would've done the same, because my [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) skills were not that great at that time. After you've done it, you're always more smart (at least for that single task you did).

## An unknown future

In contrast to people extrapolating numbers taking from surveys to predict the future of societies, I still have no clue where this personal website journey is grooving. I simply enjoy hacking on it. That's all I need right now.

Yes, it's nice to get some feedback additionaly. "Content is king" said a former employer. That's true, but empowering people to find their own pleasure is fullfilling as well.

Denzel Washington said in an interview:

* First stage of life you learn
* Next stage you earn
* Finally you return

That short formula impressed me very much. It's a life essence. I keep going as long the pumpkin on my shoulders is intact.
