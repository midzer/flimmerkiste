# How to win an online converation legally

Note: the techniques for subversive communication described in this post should only be used in experimental environments. Use at your own risk.

* Always remember: you're fighting for the good side, the other side has to be wrong
* Gather followers to support you in case you're not online and/or can't respond
* Hold your position of arguments at all cost, retreat is defeat
* Learning by doing, there are plenty of targets on the internet
* Never ever admit a mistake or say sorry, you're here to win the game
* Optimally, your tone of words is "passive-agressive", but always in the legal range of course
* Reduce your communication partners to their gender, even if is not necessary for information delivery
* Simply ghost or block your communication partner if you're running out of arguments
* Try to trigger your communication partners by learning about their (personal) backgrounds
* Use rhetorical tools wisely, they should not be discovered easily
