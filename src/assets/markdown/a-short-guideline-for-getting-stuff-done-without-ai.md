# A short guideline for getting stuff done without AI

**No signup, no costs** just your *idea* and *toolset*.

> TLDR: Use your brain ðŸ§ , not a robot ðŸ¤–.

Ten motivational steps for a satisfying life:

1. Confidence - Believe in yourself, you can do it

2. Start with a (small) project you're interested in - might even be a clone of something

3. Endurance - Eat, sleep, practice, repeat

4. Don't get distracted by News or Social Media - It's not healthy in large dosage

5. Get the money part out of your head - You won't get rich with your stuff, deal with it

6. Ask questions - Learn from others who might have done it already

7. Enjoy yourself while doing things - You can even code with your pants off

8. When you're stuck: take a break and go outside - Okay, only when the weather is nice

9. Life is not a motor race, good results will take time - It's done when you say it's done

10. Get opinions from others - Sometimes a rewarding, constructive feedback is more worth than gold
