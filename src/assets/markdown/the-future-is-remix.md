# The Future is Remix

In recent times when the political situation in each country is exhausting and difficult, people are misleadingly interpreting the future of mankind as new dark ages.

Of course, there are visually powerful series like [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) who can affirm this bias, especially in regard to technological advancement. Heavily discussed "AI" tools exploit current information to mash up and re-interpret it into something different can never contribute something new from a value-adding perspective. Apart from machines' raw computing power, they're stupid as fk and "learn" only by brute force. On the contrary, brains are playful and creative at the same time, given that fellow humans keep a "childish" attitude towards unknown issues: try out and experiment, fail or succeed, always self-enhancement. The good thing about this approach: as long as it is self-driven, in most cases it is alot of fun for the individual, too! Win-Win-(Win): life can be this simple. In this regard, I don't want to continue writing about parents "educating" their children by telling them everything beforehand. I'm no expert in this field and there are in fact real dangers around in the world which should be addressed. But the dosage makes the poison as in every other aspect of growing up.

Back on topic evaluating our options for a peaceful future as a world-wide community. Throughout playing [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)) since I was a teenager in the 90s, I realize the enormous depth of the game franchise now. According to part 4 of the series, there are exactly three possible outcomes for a players' civilization to win the game:

* Scientific victory
* Military victory
* Creative victory

First of all, in real life, in contrast to a computer game, there is no "victory" desirable to be achieved. Neither by an individual, a company, a nation or whomever. Life goes on forever on this planet as long as the sun is shining. We are all gonna die some day (deal with it), and want to have a good time while we're on earth (hopefully) alive and kickin'. Don't agree? Please stop reading then.

Let's get more into detail with previous winning categories and compare them with common life goals of entities.

## Scientific approach

Governments and their (elected) advocates mostly argue in capitalistic rhetoric for "turbo" technological progress which may lead to reinforced

* elbow-society: "performance must pay off again"
* idolatry-society: science as new "religion"
* sick-society: increasing bullshit-jobs and bore-out syndrome

## Military approach

People who want to see the world burning favor this attitude. Educated minds (or those watching post-nuke movies) know, there is no habitable planet earth after "World War III", at least for the majority of living beings. Let's skip this one altogether, alright?

## Creative approach

Okay, we're running out of options now. Either this way of living is the truth, or we're all doomed and sink in pointless nihilism.

To anticipate happiness, we're on the right path now. Go for it!

All you need to do is remix the hell out of given information, be it in audio, textual or visual form. Either analogue or digital. You decide. There is no right or wrong. It's your choice. "There are no mistakes, just tiny, little accidents." said [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross). The possibilities are endless.

Never stop learning, it's the essence of life. Yeah, don't forget amusement, chilling and other things you enjoy most. Your brain will thank you once you're old and (physically) a little rusty. Keep interpersonal exchange to gather new ideas. Your mood will thank you as well.

## Final words

As always, don't take my personal views too serious, remember I've written enjoyment? It's just my own perception of things in current world setting. Finally, quoting a sticker on my refrigerator door: "I believe in the good things coming", although latest 0day-news might tell you otherwise. Trust your own thinking.

```
This is the truth:
I never look back.
I can't explain what I feel.
I just know this is real.

Don't you wanna see is the day?
I wanna go back to reality
but I'm just addicted to stay.
Guide me the way...
...out of infinity.
```
